1 Introduction
**************

Simple Annotate is a lightweight annotation system for Emacs that
provides a non-intrusive way to add persistent notes to any text file.
Unlike other annotation systems, Simple Annotate stores your notes
separately from the original files, ensuring that your source code,
documents, and configuration files remain unchanged.

1.1 Key Features
================

   • *Non-intrusive*: Annotations are stored separately and don’t modify
     your original files
   • *Multiple formats*: Support for both single-line and multi-line
     annotations
   • *Visual highlighting*: Annotated text is highlighted with
     customizable colors
   • *Easy navigation*: Jump between annotations with simple keybindings
   • *Persistent storage*: Annotations survive between Emacs sessions
   • *Org-mode export*: List all annotations in a structured org-mode
     buffer
   • *Auto-preview*: Automatically display annotation content as you
     navigate
   • *Customizable*: Adjust colors, buffer sizes, and behavior to your
     preferences

1.2 Use Cases
=============

Simple Annotate is perfect for:

   • Code review and analysis
   • Learning new codebases
   • Research and document analysis
   • Project documentation
   • Note-taking during reading

  3. Type your note in the minibuffer and press <RET>
  4. The text is now highlighted, indicating it has an annotation

3.3 Viewing Annotations
=======================

When you move your cursor to annotated text:
   • The annotation content appears in the header line
   • An annotation buffer may automatically appear (if enabled)
   • A tooltip shows when you hover over the text

************

5.1 Moving Between Annotations
==============================

5.1.1 Next Annotation

Press ‘C-c a l’ (‘simple-annotate-list’) to open an org-mode buffer
showing all annotations in the current buffer.  This provides:

   • A structured overview of all your annotations
   • Clickable links to jump directly to each annotation
   • Line numbers for easy reference
   • The ability to export or save the annotation summary

5.3 Automatic Preview
=====================

When ‘simple-annotate-auto-show-buffer’ is enabled (the default), moving
your cursor to annotated text automatically:

   • Updates the header line with annotation information
   • Shows the annotation content in a dedicated buffer
   • Displays the annotation number and total count

7 Advanced Features
*******************

7.1 Org-mode Integration
========================

7.1.1 Annotation Listing
------------------------

The ‘simple-annotate-list’ command creates a structured org-mode buffer
with all annotations.  This buffer includes:

   • A title with the source buffer name
   • Hierarchical organization with headings
   • Clickable links to jump to annotations
   • Line numbers for reference
   • Full annotation text

7.1.2 Exporting Annotations
---------------------------

You can export your annotations by:

  1. Running ‘C-c a l’ to create the org-mode listing
  2. Saving the resulting buffer to a file
  3. Using org-mode export functions to convert to various formats

7.2 Annotation Buffer Features
==============================

7.2.1 Editing in the Annotation Buffer
--------------------------------------

When viewing an annotation in the dedicated buffer:

   • Press ‘C-x C-q’ to enter edit mode
   • Make your changes to the annotation text
   • Press ‘C-c C-c’ to save changes
   • Press ‘C-c C-k’ to cancel editing

7.2.2 Navigation from Annotation Buffer
---------------------------------------

While in the annotation buffer, you can:

   • Press ‘n’ to go to the next annotation
   • Press ‘p’ to go to the previous annotation
   • Press ‘q’ to close the annotation buffer

7.3 Data Storage Format
=======================

Annotations are stored in a Lisp data structure organized by file:

     ((file1 . ((start . 100) (end . 150) (text . "My note")))
      (file2 . ((start . 200) (end . 250) (text . "Another note"))))

   This format is:
   • Human-readable and editable
   • Version control friendly
   • Portable between systems
   • Efficient for loading and saving

8 Troubleshooting
*****************

8.1 Common Issues
=================

8.1.1 Annotations Not Persisting
--------------------------------

*Problem*: Annotations disappear between Emacs sessions.

   *Solutions*:
   • Check that ‘simple-annotate-file’ points to a writable location
   • Ensure the directory exists
   • Verify file permissions
   • Check for errors in the *Messages* buffer

8.1.2 Highlighting Not Visible
------------------------------

*Problem*: Annotated text doesn’t appear highlighted.

   *Solutions*:
   • Customize ‘simple-annotate-highlight-face’ for your color theme
   • Check for conflicting overlays from other packages
   • Try a high-contrast color scheme temporarily
   • Restart Emacs after making face changes

8.1.3 Key Bindings Not Working
------------------------------

*Problem*: Annotation commands don’t respond to key presses.

   *Solutions*:
   • Ensure ‘simple-annotate-mode’ is enabled
   • Check for conflicting key bindings with ‘C-h k’
   • Try the commands via ‘M-x’ to test functionality
   • Review your configuration for binding conflicts

8.1.4 Performance Issues
------------------------

*Problem*: Emacs feels slow with many annotations.

   *Solutions*:
   • Consider splitting large annotation databases
   • Disable ‘simple-annotate-auto-show-buffer’ for better performance
   • Use fewer visual effects in ‘simple-annotate-highlight-face’
   • Regular cleanup of unused annotations

8.2 Getting Help
================

8.2.1 Built-in Help
-------------------

   • ‘C-h m’ - Show mode documentation when ‘simple-annotate-mode’ is
     active
   • ‘C-h k’ followed by a key - Show what a key binding does
   • ‘M-x describe-variable’ - Get information about customization
     variables
   • ‘M-x describe-function’ - Get help for specific commands

8.2.2 Debugging
---------------

To debug issues:

  1. Check the *Messages* buffer for error messages
  2. Try ‘M-x toggle-debug-on-error’ to get detailed error information
  3. Test with ‘emacs -Q’ to eliminate configuration conflicts
  4. Verify the annotation file contents manually

8.2.3 Reporting Bugs
--------------------

When reporting issues, please include:

   • Emacs version (‘M-x emacs-version’)
   • Simple Annotate version
   • Minimal configuration to reproduce the problem
   • Steps to reproduce the issue
   • Error messages or unexpected behavior description
