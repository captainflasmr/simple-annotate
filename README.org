A lightweight annotation system for Emacs that allows you to add persistent notes to any text file without modifying the original content.

I developed this package to fill a gap in the existing Emacs note-taking ecosystem. Although =annotate.el= comes close to what I needed, I wanted something with a few workflow adjustments that better suit my note-taking preferences. The result is a lightweight alternative that handles annotations the way I've always wanted them to work.

The main functional aspects that I felt were important to me that generally differ from other existing Emacs annotation packages are:

- Header-line status display
- Multi-line annotation editing via a buffer
- Dedicated annotation buffer
  - Pops up when point is over an annotation
  - Ability to edit annotation from within the buffer
  - Can quickly step through annotations with =n= and =p=
 - org buffer summary of annotations (although =annotate.el= also has this)

See [[file:docs/simply-annotate.org]] for the manual!

* Features

- *Non-intrusive*: Annotations are stored separately and don't modify your original files
- *Multiple formats*: Support for both single-line and multi-line annotations
- *Visual highlighting*: Annotated text is highlighted with customizable colors
- *Easy navigation*: Jump between annotations with simple keybindings
- *Persistent storage*: Annotations survive between Emacs sessions
- *Org-mode export*: List all annotations in a structured org-mode buffer
- *Auto-preview*: Automatically display annotation content as you navigate
- *Customizable*: Adjust colors, buffer sizes, and behavior to your preferences

* Installation

** MELPA (Recommended)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package simply-annotate
  :bind ("C-c A" . simply-annotate-mode))
#+end_src

** Manual Installation

1. Download =simply-annotate.el=
2. Place it in your Emacs =load-path=
3. Add to your configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'simply-annotate)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c A") simply-annotate-mode)
#+end_src

* Quick Start

1. *Enable the mode*: =M-x simply-annotate-mode= (or use =C-c A= if you've set up the binding)
2. *Add an annotation*: Select text and press =C-c a a=
3. *Navigate*: Use =C-c a n= (next) and =C-c a p= (previous) to move between annotations
4. **View all**: Press =C-c a l= to see all annotations in an org-mode list

* Usage

** Basic Operations

| Keybinding | Command                         | Description                                  |

** Creating Annotations

*** Single-line Annotations

1. Select text or place cursor on a line
2. Press =C-c a a=
3. Type your annotation in the minibuffer
4. Press =Enter=

*** Multi-line Annotations

1. Select text or place cursor on a line  
2. Press =C-c a m=
3. A dedicated buffer opens for editing
4. Type your multi-line annotation
5. Press =C-c C-c= to save or =C-c C-k= to cancel

** Viewing Annotations

When =simply-annotate-mode= is active:

- Annotated text is highlighted with a colored background
- The header line shows annotation count and available commands
- Moving your cursor to annotated text automatically displays the annotation content
- A dedicated annotation buffer can show detailed information

** Managing Annotations

*** Editing

- Place cursor on annotated text
- Press =C-c a e= to edit the annotation
- For multi-line annotations, a dedicated editing buffer opens

*** Deleting

- Place cursor on annotated text
- Press =C-c a d= to remove the annotation

*** Listing All Annotations

- Press =C-c a l= to open an org-mode buffer showing all annotations
- Click on line numbers to jump directly to annotations
- Perfect for getting an overview of all your notes

* Customization

** Basic Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package simply-annotate
  :custom
  ;; Customize highlight colors
  (simply-annotate-highlight-face '(:background "lightblue" :foreground "darkblue"))
  
  ;; Change annotation buffer height (fraction of frame)
  (simply-annotate-buffer-height 0.25)
  
  ;; Disable auto-show buffer
  (simply-annotate-auto-show-buffer nil)
  
  ;; Custom storage location
  (simply-annotate-file "~/my-annotations.el")
  
  :bind
  ("C-c A" . simply-annotate-mode))
#+end_src

** Available Customization Options

| Variable                           | Default                            | Description                            |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------|
| =simply-annotate-file=             | =~/.emacs.d/simply-annotations.el= | File to store annotations              |
| =simply-annotate-highlight-face=   | Yellow background, black text      | Face for highlighted text              |
| =simply-annotate-buffer-name=      | =*Annotation*=                     | Name of annotation display buffer      |
| =simply-annotate-auto-show-buffer= | =t=                                | Auto-show annotation buffer on hover   |
| =simply-annotate-buffer-height=    | =0.3=                              | Height of annotation buffer (fraction) |

** Custom Highlight Colors

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Subtle highlighting
(setq simply-annotate-highlight-face '(:background "#fff3cd" :foreground "#856404"))

;; High contrast
(setq simply-annotate-highlight-face '(:background "#007acc" :foreground "white" :weight bold))

;; Use existing face
(setq simply-annotate-highlight-face 'highlight)
#+end_src

* Data Storage

Annotations are stored in a separate file (by default =~/.emacs.d/simply-annotations.el=) and are organized by file path or buffer name. The storage format is:

- **Persistent**: Survives Emacs restarts
- **Portable**: Can be version controlled or shared
- **Non-intrusive**: Original files remain unchanged
- **Efficient**: Only loads annotations for the current buffer

* Tips and Tricks

** Workflow Suggestions

1. *Enable globally for specific file types*:
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'simply-annotate-mode)
   (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'simply-annotate-mode)
   #+end_src

3. *Export annotations to file*:
   
   Use =C-c a l= then save the org-mode buffer to export your annotations.

** Performance Notes

- Annotations are loaded on-demand per buffer
- Large numbers of annotations (100+) may slightly impact performance
- Consider splitting very large annotation databases

* Troubleshooting

** Common Issues

*** Annotations not persisting

- Check that =simply-annotate-file= is writable
- Ensure the directory exists

*** Highlighting not visible

- Customize =simply-annotate-highlight-face= for your color theme
- Check for conflicting overlays from other packages

*** Keybindings not working

- Ensure =simply-annotate-mode= is enabled
- Check for conflicting keybindings with =C-h k=

** Getting Help

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; View current annotations
M-x simply-annotate-list

;; Check mode status  
M-x describe-mode

;; View keybindings
C-h m (when simply-annotate-mode is active)
#+end_src
